## Item3: Managing dotfiles

*This item covers version control of configuration files*

We've mentioned "dotfiles" in the #item1, the local configuration files
in your $HOME directory, the ones that start with a '.' and so that
are hidden.

It's always better to keep the customizations you make in your home but why?

There are a few reasons:

* The configurations are local, you don't have to impose it on all users
* You don't need root access to edit them, so it's safer
* It's more manageable

That last point is what we're interested in for this chapter.
