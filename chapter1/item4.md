## Item4: File Managers

*This item will cover the ins and outs of file managers*

A filesystem is composed of many types of files, be it directories,
media, text, etc.. "On Unix, everything is a file".

There are basic operations that can be done on those files, renaming them,
moving them, copying them, listing/browsing them, editing them.

This is the role of the file manager.

The command line "core utils" could be considered a file manager in
itself and some persons prefer it over other fully fledge file managers.

You can issue `cp` to copy files, `mv` to move them around, `mv` also
to rename them, `ls` to list them, `pwd` to see in which directory you
are currently, etc..

The advantage of the command line is that it's built-in the shell and
doesn't require to install any additional software.

If one is looking to have a very minimal setup and don't want to avoid
installing third party softwares then this is the route to go to.

So what are the other choices how do we customize them, how do we choose
the one that suits our needs.

There are two interfaces for interaction with a file manager, or it's
terminal based or it's GUI based.

For the terminal based, or it's a command line program or it's a curses
interface.

A curses interface is an interface, like the one you'd find in graphical
program, but made out of text.

As with the command line those softwares are light and don't usually
require dependencies.

Here's a lit of the most frequently used ones:

* ranger
* vifm
* vidir
* commander
* mc (midnight commander)
