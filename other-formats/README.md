# Alternative Formats
This directory contains `convert.sh`, which will convert the contents of the book from
Markdown into a variety of other formats.

Supported formats are

 - LaTeX
 - HTML
 - Man page

## Running the Script

Very simple:

    $ ./convert.sh

This will convert the markdown files from book into all of the supported formats.
These copies are stored in their respective subdirectories.

_Important_: Every chapter filename must be addded to `chapters.txt` for this to
function properly.

Alternatively, you can specify the format you wish to convert to. For example,
to generate HTML:

    $ ./convert.sh html

This will generate the HTML version of the book.

## Adding more formats

To add a new format, create a subdirectory with a sensible name
This subdirectory should contain a shell script
named 'gen.sh'. This script should take two
arguments - the name and path to the markdown source file,
and the name of the markdown source file with the
file extension removed (in that order).

`gen.sh` scripts perform all of the work required to convert
the markdown source to whichever format. See `html/gen.sh` for
an example
